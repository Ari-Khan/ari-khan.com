                My name is Ari Khan, and I'm a technology and innovation enthusiast who loves bringing ideas to life.
                I enjoy developing software, programming, 3D modelling, and robotics. While not working on technology,
                I spend my time playing the piano, playing soccer, or staying on top of my investment portfolio.
                I am a goal-oriented individual who enjoys finding innovative, modern solutions to develop new tools
                and services for people worldwide.
                <br><br>
                As we look to the future, my goal is to develop innovative projects to assist users, whether it be for
                engineering, finance, or entertainment purposes.
