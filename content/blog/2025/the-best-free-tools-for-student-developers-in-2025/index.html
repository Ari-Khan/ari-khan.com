                <b>Let's face it.</b> 
                <br><br>You've spent <b>countless hours</b> searching for free tools to develop your project, but they're either years out of date, as complex as C++ templates, or require "free credits" to access.
                <br><br><b>I can relate.</b> For students exploring technology, it can be challenging to navigate through countless tools when <b>outstanding resources</b> are buried among less effective ones.
                <br><br><b>Fortunately</b>, a handful of powerful platforms stand out for their usability, integration, and overall support for the creative development process.
                <h1>1.  Figma</h1>
                <img class="body-image" src="../../../blog/2025/the-best-free-tools-for-student-developers-in-2025/figma.webp" alt="Image of Figma.">
                <br><b>Figma</b> is a browser-based <b>design tool</b> used to create user interfaces, wireframes, and prototypes, without having to download anything. Figma can be used to develop blueprints of <b>websites</b>, <b>software</b>, or <b>mobile applications</b> before you are ready to transition to the development phase.
                <br><br>Its <b>real-time collaboration</b> features make it easy to work with classmates or receive feedback, and its simple interface helps students quickly visualize their ideas without needing programming experience.
                <br><br><b>Unlike Canva</b>, which focuses on quick visuals and templates, Figma emphasizes structured design, prototyping, and teamwork.
                <br><br><b>Keep in mind </b> that Figma cannot be used to publish websites or applications, and is mainly a tool for earlier stages in the design process.
                <h1>2.  Gemini</h1>
                <img class="body-image" src="../../../blog/2025/the-best-free-tools-for-student-developers-in-2025/gemini.webp" alt="Image of Google Gemini.">
                <br><b>Often overlooked</b> due to tools such as ChatGPT, <b>Google Gemini</b> serves as a powerful AI assistant capable of supporting tasks beyond simple conversation.
                <br><br>As of May 2025, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro is the <b>top-ranked</b> AI model in terms of versatility, linguistic precision, and cultural context. 
                <br><br><b>Contrasting other platforms</b>, Google Gemini allows you to generate an <b>unlimited</b> number of AI images for <b>free</b>, using Google's Imagen 3.
                <br><br><b>For developers</b>, Google AI Studio allows you to integrate Google's AI models within your application through backend APIs. This could allow you to add AI features to your website or sort data in your applications using languages like Python or JavaScript.
                <h1>3.  Visual Studio Code</h1>
                <img class="body-image" src="../../../blog/2025/the-best-free-tools-for-student-developers-in-2025/visualStudioCode.webp" alt="Image of Visual Studio Code.">
                <br><b>Frequently chosen</b> by developers of all skill levels, <b>Visual Studio Code</b> is a lightweight yet powerful code editor trusted across industries.
                <br><br>Known for its <b>speed</b>, <b>flexibility</b>, and <b>robust ecosystem</b>, VS Code supports dozens of languages out of the box, from Python to TypeScript, and can be heavily customized to match any workflow.
                <br><br>VS Code can also be used to accelerate the development process through <b>extensions</b>. Extensions like Live Server let you <b>preview your HTML and CSS designs</b> in real time, without needing to redeploy your entire website after every change.
                <h1>4.  Github</h1>
                <img class="body-image" src="../../../blog/2025/the-best-free-tools-for-student-developers-in-2025/github.webp" alt="Image of GitHub.">
                <br><b>GitHub</b> is a web-based platform that allows developers to <b>host</b>, <b>manage</b>, and <b>collaborate</b> on code repositories using Git version control, without needing to install software locally. GitHub can be used to <b>organize projects</b>, <b>track changes</b>, and <b>coordinate teamwork</b> throughout the development lifecycle.
                <br><br>Its inferface makes it easy to <b>control issues</b> and <b>share files</b>, helping both beginners and experienced developers efficiently manage their code.
                <br><br> <b>Actions</b> in GitHub allow you to sit back and enjoy the product of your code <b>without</b> having to complete repetitive tasks. Automations like these help standardize the development process and <b>reduce human-error</b> within the development process.
                <h1>5.  Vercel</h1>
                <img class="body-image" src="../../../blog/2025/the-best-free-tools-for-student-developers-in-2025/vercel.webp" alt="Image of Vercel.">
                <br><b>Vercel</b> is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy websites and web applications directly from their code repositories, without having to manually upload files. Vercel can be used to host <b>static and dynamic sites</b>, <b>serverless functions</b>, and <b>full-stack applications</b> with minimal configuration.
                <br><br><b>Insights</b> allow you to track web performance in Vercel, while the <b>console and documentation</b> allow you to resolve issues efficiently. 
                <br><br> Bear in mind that there is a <b>moderate learning curve</b> associated with Vercel, and it may be easier for new developers to host their websites on static hosts such as GitHub Pages.
