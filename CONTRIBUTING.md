# Contributing to ari-khan.com
I'd love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
  
I use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests.

## Report Bugs
I use GitHub's "issues" tab to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Great Bug Reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Specific steps to reproduce
- Sample Code
- What you expected versus what happened
- Notes and possible solutions
